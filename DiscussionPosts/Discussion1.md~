# Pandora Radio

[Pandora Radio](https://www.pandora.com/station/play/3995404477674896416) is an
online music subscription service the customizes a users music feed to must
appleal to their individual preferences. They are particularily interesting
because of the lengths they've gone to to perfect content based recomenders.

## Content Based Recomender Systems (CBRS)

These systems can be thought of as a using the atributes of a product to
recomend similar ones. For example, if I like _beef bourguignon_ a CBRS would
recomend _coq au vin_ because they are both protiene based, braised French dishes
that emphasize red wine and brady along with root vegetables.

## Collaberative Filtering Recomender System (CFRS)

CFRS base their recomendations off of what similar users also enjoyed. In this
case, I like beef bourguignon and user X like beef _bourguignon_ and _coq au
vin_, thus it would recommended that.

## Costs and Benefits

CBRS benefit from not having a 'cold start'. I can be recomended similar
products as soon as I reveal my preference for one. Userprofiles do not need to
be ketp which makes this ideal for sites that don't have logins
etc. Unfortunetly, these systems require lots of investment to lable the content
library. They also don't adapt well to slight changes in individual preference
or even just bad products that have similar meta data.

CFRS on the other hand are cheaper to implement and can be highly personalized
but require a lot of data to start.

## Pandora's Recomender System

Pandora is interesting because they took the CBRS so far. Pandora has something
they call the [Music Genome Project
(MGP)](https://www.pandora.com/about/mgp). This is a vector of over 450 features
such as genera, tempo etc. This is a highly ambitious project given the cost of
employing 'musicologists' to classify every song. Rumor has it that each song
takes 15-30 minutes to classify.

As far as I can tell, Pandora does not reley on colaberative filtering at
all. Hoever, it does build a user profile. If I start playing music by Weezer
and the next song played has similar attributes/meta data but I don't like it,
Pandora will update my preferences. 

This is interesting because rather unknown bands have an equal chance of
matching a user's criteria. While the style may not be original, the bands might
be. 

While Pandora seems to claim that they don't use any collaborative filtering, 
I remain a bit skeptical that they haven't at least looked at implementing it in
conjunction with the MGP.
