    "> _The goal of this project is give you practice beginning to work with a distributed recommender system. It is sufficient for this assignment to build out your application on a single node._\n",
    "\n",
    "> Adapt one of your recommendation systems to work with Apache Spark and compare the performance with your previous iteration. Consider the efficiency of the system and the added complexity of using Spark. You may complete the assignment using PySpark (Python), SparkR (R) , sparklyr (R), or Scala.\n",
    "\n",
    "In every project except the first I tried to implement Spark. However, I struggled with Java versions as well as spark locations. Eventually, I installed spark through sparklyr, the API has a command that install spark. I then deleted Java 10 from my computer and just had one version of 8. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now it works flawlesly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of my work was done in python, so I didn't use `recommenderlab` which is an R library. Instead, I used [Implicit](http://implicit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This comes with a built in ALS function. I'll compare these two.\n",

    "First of all, a rehash of assignment 3 using Implicit. The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/kaiserxc/DATA643/blob/master/Project3/Project3.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunetly, Implicit doesn't run on my computer so I cann't compare the times that it takes to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also unfortunetly, I don't have the rmse values. However, I think the accuracy on this small scale will be similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "While getting spark to work is more difficult at the start, the pyspark API is much easier to work with after the fact and makes working with recommenders easy and pleasurable. \n",

    "\n",
    "As stated above, the Spark API is great for ALS, less good for something like SVD, although the capacity is still there, and horrible for setting up on a single cluster on my computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Honestly, for any ALS implementation in python, Spark is necessary off the bat. The Surprise package just doesn't cut it and nothing else is there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, the distributed computing is another huge plus for spark. Any time the matrix size gets around the size of memory e.g., 16 Gigs you will need Spark. Even huge processors like on AWS might be able to fit it (128g) they are expensive and slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another time spark might be used is in situations where recommendations are needed in real time, say after a movie is watched. Spark can help speed this up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, we plan on doing a final project on AWS where we will explore the benefits and costs more deeply."
